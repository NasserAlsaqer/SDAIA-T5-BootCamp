Bagging is an ensemble technique mainly used for reducing the variance of a predictive model and preventing overfitting. The main idea behind bagging is to combine multiple learners in a way that the ensemble model performs better than an individual model.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","We will use the Iris dataset for this exercise. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset from the field of machine learning, containing measurements for iris flowers of three different species. **Feel free to use another dataset!!**\n","\n","## Task\n","Your task is to:\n","1. Load the dataset.\n","2. Preprocess the data (if necessary).\n","3. Implement Bagging models.\n","4. Evaluate the models performance.\n","\n","Please fill in the following code blocks to complete the exercise.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"cd906704","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1951,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722869778969,"user":{"displayName":"ناصر

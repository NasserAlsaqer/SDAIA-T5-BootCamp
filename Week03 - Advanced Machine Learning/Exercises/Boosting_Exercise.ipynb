It combines multiple weak learners into a single strong learner. The learners are trained sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","We will use the Breast Cancer dataset for this exercise. This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass and is used to predict whether the mass is malignant or benign. **Feel free to use another dataset!!**\n","\n","## Task\n","Your task is to:\n","1. Load the dataset.\n","2. Preprocess the data (if necessary).\n","3. Implement boosting models.\n","4.
